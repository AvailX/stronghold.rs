<span class="doccomment">//! ## Introduction</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This library enables strongholds on different devices and in different networks to communicate with each other.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The main basis for its functionality is the [rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) library, which is a system of protocols, specifications and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications (https://libp2p.io/).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Libp2p was originally the network protocol of IPFS and has evolved into a modular system with implementations in</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Node.js, Go and Rust. It is important to note that at the current status, the Rust implementation doesn&#39;t have all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! features yet and especially peer discovery in different networks, NAT Traversal and Firewalls pose a problem that we</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! solved for stronghold by using a mailbox concept that is described further down below.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Transport and the Swarm</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Libp2p uses the `transport` as the lowest layer, that is responsible for sending and receiving data over a network.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The current rust implementation supports tcp and websockets, and apart from that provides the option to upgrade a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! connection with protocols for multiplexing and authentication.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The second important concept of libp2p is its `Swarm` (in newer implementations and documents also called `Switch`).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The swarm is responsible for negotiating protocols, managing transports and sending and receiving messages via</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! different protocols. It is possible to combine different protocols into a so called `NetworkBehaviour`, which is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! what this library is doing. Stronghold-communication uses multicast DNS (mDNS) for peer discovery in a local</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! network, the identify protocol to receive information about newly connected peers, and the RequestResponse protocol</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! in order to send / receive custom messages and parse them.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Multiplexing and Noise-encryption</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The transport of stronghold-communication is upgraded with yamux for multiplexing and the noise protocol, this noise</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! protocol uses the XX-Handshake and ensures authentication and encryption.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Stronghold-Communication</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Stronghold-communication creates the `P2PNetworkBehaviour` struct for sending messages and reacting upon the outcome</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of the operation. Upon creating a new instance, a transport is created and upgraded, and combined with the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! P2PNetworkBehaviour into a ExpandedSwarm. This Swarm is returned to the caller and serves as entry-point for all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! communication to other peers. Additionally to the methodes of `libp2p::swarm::ExpandedSwarm`, it enables sending</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! outbound messages, and manually adding and dialing peers. Incoming `P2PEvent` can be handled by polling from the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! swarm, e.g. via the `next` method. Due to libp2ps concept of `multiaddresses`, the swarm has multiple listening</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! addresses that encode different addressing schemes for different protocols. Apart from IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! these multiaddresses can also be dns addresses, which is relevant if a peer is listening to such an address on a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! server. The listed multiaddresses are only the ones within the same local network, but if port forwarding was</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! configured, the local `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/12345` Address can be replaced by the public one or by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! `/dns/my.public.server.address/ tcp/12345`, where the `/tcp/12345` part describes the port.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Mailbox Concept</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Since not all peers can be dialed directly e.g. because they are behind a firewall, stronghold-communication</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! includes an example and dockerfile for using a mailbox. The mailbox is a peer running on a server with public IP</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Address that can be reached by all other peers. If can be used to deposit records for unavailable remote peers by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! sending a `Request::PutRecord` message with the record to the mailbox, and that can then return the Records to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! remote peers upon receiving a `Request::GetRecord` request.</span>
